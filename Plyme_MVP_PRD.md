# Plyme MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> Plyme is a Gen-Z focused, iOS-only, TikTok-style slideshow app for discovering, saving, and shopping healthy, simple recipes. MVP will be built with Expo + React Native, using Supabase as the backend. All UGC will be seeded for launch.

---

## üéØ Core Problem
People want to eat healthier, cook at home, and be inspired by recipes ‚Äî but most recipe apps are bloated and impersonal. Gen Z users increasingly discover meals on TikTok, where they see them visually and decide in seconds. Plyme brings that exact experience to a native app.

---

- Can save, like, and explore recipes via a TikTok-style interface
